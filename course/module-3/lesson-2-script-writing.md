## The Script Structure

### Part 1: The Hook (First 3 Seconds)

**Why It Matters**:
- First 3 seconds determine if viewers stay
- 50%+ of viewers leave in first 3 seconds
- Hook = retention = algorithm boost

**Types of Hooks**:

**1. Question Hook**:
- "What if you could create videos in 5 minutes?"
- "Have you ever wondered why some channels grow faster?"
- "What's the one mistake costing you thousands of views?"

**2. Bold Statement Hook**:
- "I made $1,000 in my first month using this strategy..."
- "This one change increased my views by 300%..."
- "Most creators are doing this wrong..."

**3. Problem Hook**:
- "Tired of spending hours creating videos?"
- "Struggling to get views on your content?"
- "Can't figure out how to get monetized?"

**4. Benefit Hook**:
- "Learn how to create 10 videos in 50 minutes..."
- "Discover the strategy that got me 1,000 subscribers..."
- "Get monetized in 2 weeks with this method..."

**Pro Tip**: Test different hooks to see what works for your audience.

### Part 2: The Introduction (3-10 Seconds)

**What It Does**:
- Expands on the hook
- Sets up the value
- Builds interest
- Keeps viewers watching

**Structure**:
1. Acknowledge the problem/desire
2. Promise the solution
3. Preview what they'll learn
4. Transition to main content

**Example**:
"You're probably spending hours creating each video, right? What if I told you there's a way to create professional videos in just 5 minutes? Today, I'm going to show you exactly how to do that using AI. By the end of this video, you'll know the exact system I use to create 10 videos per day."
