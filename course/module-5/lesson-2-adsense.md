## Ad Placement Optimization

### Long-Form Video Ads

**Ad Slots**:
- **Pre-roll**: Before video (always shown)
- **Mid-roll**: During video (every 8 minutes)
- **Post-roll**: After video (always shown)

**Optimization**:
- **8+ minute videos**: Get mid-roll ads
- **10+ minute videos**: Multiple mid-roll opportunities
- **20+ minute videos**: Maximum ad slots

**Example**:
- 20-minute video = 1 pre-roll + 2 mid-rolls + 1 post-roll = 4 ad slots
- More ad slots = more revenue potential

**Pro Tip**: Create 10-20 minute videos for maximum ad revenue.

---

### Shorts Ads

**How They Work**:
- Ads integrated automatically
- Lower CPM than long-form
- Higher view counts
- Different payment structure

**Strategy**: Use Shorts for growth, long-form for revenue.

---

## Retention = Revenue

### Why Retention Matters

**The Connection**:
- Higher retention = more ads shown
- More ads shown = more revenue
- Algorithm favor = more views
- Better performance = higher CPM

**Example**:
- 20-minute video, 50% retention = 10 minutes watched
- 20-minute video, 30% retention = 6 minutes watched
- **67% more watch time** = more ads = more revenue

**Pro Tip**: Focus on retention - it directly impacts revenue.
